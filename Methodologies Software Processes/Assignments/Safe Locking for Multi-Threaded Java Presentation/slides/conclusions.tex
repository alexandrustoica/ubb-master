\frametitle{Conclusions}
The static type and effect system solves the following challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item dynamic lock creation 
    \item passing of lock references
    \item aliasing of lock references
\end{itemize}

Assuring absence of lock errors is thus basically a sequential problem, as one can ignore interference (a parallel program can be dealt with compositionally).

\frametitle{Conclusions}
The main assumption restricts passing the lock references via instance fields.
\\ \newline
There are basically only two possible ways hand over the identity of a lock:
\begin{itemize}
    \item via the thread constructor
    \item via an instance field
\end{itemize}
