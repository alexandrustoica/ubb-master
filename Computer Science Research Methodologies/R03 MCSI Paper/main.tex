\begin{abstract}
Both monads and aspects had become a popular encapsulation method of effects into a legacy system. Programmers are increasingly using monads in their functional environments, and aspects in object-oriented settings to reduce their code's complexity and add features to their products. In this paper, we create a comparative analysis between monads and aspects, presenting their advantages and disadvantages in different contexts.
