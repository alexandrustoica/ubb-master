Interview#03

1. Did your company provide internship positions for students?

Yes, we had around four or five interview sessions for internship positions. We offer an internship program combined in training sessions; we expect to keep our interns as longtime partners after they ended this program.  

2. Is your company interested in students who are just looking for an internship without a longtime commitment?

At the moment we're not intrested in short commitments because we have limited resources; I'm taking into consideration the idea of making a mobile academy for students, as a learning centre.

3. What tools are you using to find candidates for internship positions?

We're using Facebook Ads with work with Instagram too.

4. On average, how many applications do you have for such a position?

Between 15 and 20 people, but only five of them will take our interview; sometimes most of our applicants don't meet our standards.

5. What is the primary selection criteria that help you filter candidates?

We're looking for candidates who are pursuing a university degree in computer science or related field or who have an exciting project in development. 

6. What is your opinion on internship candidates that already have been through a similar experience in other companies? 

Most of our applicants already have two or three internships; I think it raises a question about the candidate such as "Why is he not working at company X?" where he worked as an intern.

From my expertise, those candidates were unable to get a stable job after their program, a fact which makes me believe they are unprepared for our industry. The vast majority of companies keep the most productive interns for a full-time or part-time job.
