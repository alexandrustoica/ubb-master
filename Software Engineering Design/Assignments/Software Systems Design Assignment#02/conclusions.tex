\section{Conclusions}

\begin{conclusion}
Dissimilar with other pipeline architectures, VTK uses executive objects to coordinate the interactions between data components and process components. This design decision creates a complex data flow infrastructure, which is difficult to analyse and trace.
\end{conclusion}

\begin{conclusion}
Despite the overall simple architecture, the rendering system is too challenging to extend. Creating a new type of filter requires detailed planning and solving multiple edge cases for distributed data and parallel execution.
\end{conclusion}
