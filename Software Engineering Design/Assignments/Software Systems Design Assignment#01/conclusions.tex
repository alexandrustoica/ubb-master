\begin{conclusion}
GHC managed to improve its scalability by relying on a simplified programming language called Core in optimisation and code generating phases.
\end{conclusion}

\begin{conclusion}
Almost any new feature requires changes to the Rename system because the module propagates pieces of information to the rest of the compiler.
